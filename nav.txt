You can use this file to practice navigating.

To move down a line, press "j".

To move up a line, press "k".

To move to the right, press "l".

To move to the left, press "h".

You can also press and hold a navigation key so that it repeats.
To move all the way to the top of the file, press and hold "k".
To move all the way to the bottom of the file, press and hold "j".

To move forward in the file, use Ctrl-f. Hold down the control key and press "f".
Ctrl-f is the same as the "page down" operation.

To move backward in the file, use Ctrl-b. Hold down the control key and press "b".
Ctrl-b is the same as the "page up" operation.

To move forward by word, use "w". To move forward by word using white space as
word boundaries, use "W".

To move backward by word, use "b". To move backword by word using white space
as word boundaries, use "B".

To go to the begining of the file, type "1gg" or just "gg".
To move to the last line of the file, type "$G" or just "G".
To go to a specific line number use <LINE_NUMBER>gg or <LINE_NUMBER>G.  For
example, to go to line 27, type 27gg or 27G.

You can even use line mode to go to a specific line.  For example, to move to
line 32, you would type ":32<ENTER>".  To go to the last line, use ":$<ENTER>".

The rest of this file is comprised of random sentences.  This will give you a
chance to practice.  There is no need to study the contents of the remaining
portions of this file.

  Far far away, behind the wild mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

  A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
sentences fly into your mouth.

  Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

  The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because agile frameworks also provide
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, and every Lorem Ipsum spaces
didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic
Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown
Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own
road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
continued her way.

  On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where
it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that
was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text
should turn around and return to its own, safe country.

  But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn't take long until
a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
and dragged her into their agency, where they abulorem ipsum dolor sit amet sed
again and again. And if she hasn't been rewritten, aute irure dolor in totam re
her.

If you want to redraw the screen press `z<ENTER>`

to go to first character of a line press `^`

`<Ctrl>g` to get the information about line position and characters.
`g<Ctrl>g` to get more information about line position and characters.
to set ruler `:set ruler` will display line number and column number.
to set ruler off `:set noruler`
vim options can be set using the command `:set`
vim options pattern, option like `ruler` to set use `ruler` if you want to set off just prefix with `no` like `noruler`
another good pattern is using `!` at the end of option to toggle.

# essential navigation commands

Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice moving around within a file.

instructions:

open the nav.txt file

first, start a command line session on your local machine.
next, use vim to open `nav.txt` file that came in the course downloads.
To do that, navigate to the location of the file.
Remember this could be different for you depending on where you extracted the contents of the file.
This example assumes the course download was saved into your downloads folder and extrated from there.

```cd downloads
cd vimclass
vim nav.txt```

practice moving the cursor by one line or one character

press the `j` key 10 times to move down 10 lines.
this will move you down to this line in the file.

you can also press and hold a navigation key so that it repeats.

press `k` 4 times to move up 4 lines.
this will the cursor to the beginning of this line.

to move to the right, press l.

press the l key 8 times to move to the word to.

press the j key 2 times to this line.

to move to the left, press "h".

notice how the cursor is in the same column.
(the cursor is the same distance from the left of the line as it was before.)

now move the cursor to the begining of the line by pressing the h key to that it repeats.

finally, move the cursor to the very top of the file by pressing and holding the k key so that it repeats.

practice mvoing the cursor by page.

press ctrl + f to move down one page.
press ctrl + b to move back up one page.

hold down the ctrl key and press f as many times as needed to get to the bottom of the file.
the number of times you need to page down wil vary based on the size of your screen.
remember that the tildes represents lines beyond the end of the file.

this is what it might look like when you get to the bottom of the file.
(again, this will vary based on your screen size.)
notice th tildes.

move up one page by holding down the ctrl key and pressing b.

practice moving the cursor by word

place your cursor at the begining of the following line.
one easy way to do this would be to press and hold the k key until you reach the line.
if you go above it, return to the line by pressing j.

far far away, behind the wild mountains, far from the countries vokalia and

press lowercase w 4 times.
your cursor will be at the first comma(,) in the line.
press lowercase w 5 more times.
your cursor will now be at the second comma (,) in the line.

move back to the first word in the sentence (Far) by pressing the lowercase b key 8 times.
notice how it also considers the comma to be a word.

now move forward to the word "behind" by pressing uppercase W 3 times.
notice how your cursor does not stop at the comma.
move forward to the word far by pressing uppercase W 4 more times.

return to the first word of the line by repeatedly pressing uppercase B.
you'll need to press B 7 times to do this.

practice moving the cursor to the specific line number
go to the first line in the file by typing gg.
go to the last line in the file by typing uppercase G.
go back to the first line by typing 1gg.
notice how it does the same thing as gg.
now, go to line 29 by typing 29gg.

you can also use G to go to a specific line number.
go to line 3 by typing 3G.

now use the line mode to move to line 44.
type :44<ENTER>.
now move to the last line in the file by typing :$<ENTER>

confirm that you are indeed on the last line by typing Ctrl + g and displaying information about the file you're editing.
(you should see 100% displayed on the status line.)

your turn
if you're up to it, have some fun navigating around the file using what you know.

quit vim
when you are done practicing your file navigation skills, quit with :q!<ENTER>.
