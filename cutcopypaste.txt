In the works of Eco, a predominant concept is the distinction between opening

challenge hierarchy. Thus, the characteristic theme of la Fournier’s analysis of
subcultural theory is the difference between class and society.

cut, copy & paste... why???
. move text around a file
. duplicate text
. make an in-file backup
. reuse the same text

you've already been cutting
. d and x cut text, not just deleting it
. cut = delete and save into a register
. register is a clipboard-like storage location

standard vs vim
cut = delete
copy = yank
paste = put

yy = copy the line

register types
. unnamed
  ""
  "" holds text from d, c, s, x and y operations
. numbered
  "0 "1 ... "9
  "0 holds last text yanked (y)
  "1 holds last text deleted (d) or changed (c)
  numbered registers shift with each d or c
. named

to view registers type `:reg<ENTER>`


Cut, Copy, and Paste (Delete, Yank, and Put)
Goal:
The goal of this exercise is to give you practice with cut, copy, and paste operations.
Additionally you'll get a chance to work with registers.

Instructions:

Open the dyp,txt file

First, start a command line session on your local machine.
Next, use vim to open the "dyp.tx" file that cam in the course downloads.
To do that, navigate to the location of the file.
Remember this could be different for you depending on where you extracted the contens of the file.
This example assumes the course download was saved into your Downloads folder and extracted from there.

cd Downloads
cd vimclass
vim dyp.txt

First, delete the first line of the file by typing dd.
This places the line into the default register.
Now put the line below the new first line in the file with the p command.

Here is what the first wo lines of the file look like before you edit.

This was originally the first line in the file.
This was originally the second line in the file.

Here is what they look like after:

This was originally the second line in the file.
This was originally the first line in the file.

Put the first line in another place in the file

Remember that you can reuse the contents of the default register.
Place the original first line of the file just below this line:

What was the first line in the file originally? Place it below:

To do that, position your cursor on that line and use the put command by typeing p.

Practice putting lines above your cursor position

Put the original first line in the file just above this line:
What was the first line in the file originally? Place it above:

To do that, place your cursor on that line and type P.

Fix spelling/typing mistakes by swapping characters

Position your cursor under the "e" on this line:
teh

Swap the "e" and "h" so that the word reads "the".
To do that, type x to delete the "e" and p to paste it after your current cursor position.

Use the same process to fix the spelling or typing mistakes on the following four lines:
psell = spell
vmi = vim
wrod = word
taht = that

Swap words

Change this line from:
second, First, third.

To
First, second, third.

To do that position your cursor at the beginning of the line under the s in the word second.
Delete it along with the comma that follows with the dW command.
(Notice the capital W).
Next, position your cursor at the beginning of the word third by typing W.
Now put the text in the default register before your cursor position with the P command.

Duplicate a line

Duplicate the following line, placing another copy of it just below it:
Duplicate this line.
Position your cursor on the line and yank it into the default register with yy.
Next. paste it below the line with the p command.

Duplicate a word

Duplicate the words "really, really," on the following line:

I really, really, love vim!

Place your cursor under r in the first occurence of the word really.
Next yank those two words, including the puctuation, into the default register with y2W.
Next, paste them before your current cursor position with P.

I really, really, really, really, love vim!
