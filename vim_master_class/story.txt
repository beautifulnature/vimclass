once there was a rich man in Thailand.
His name was chulong.
He was a very rich man.
Yet he wanted more riches, more money.

One one day he was walking in his garden.
He saw a strange bird in a bush.
It was very small.
But it had very beautiful and colourful features.
It's voice was also very sweet.
Chulong had never seen such a bird in his life.
He slowly went near the bush unseen.
He caught the bird.
Now the bird began to speak.
the this spelling is wrong.

In the sky there are always answers and explanations for everything: every pain, every suffering, joy and confusion.

We long for things that harm us and run from the things that grow and heal us.
We think good is bad and bad is good.

It was unfair that people who longed for love the most, searched the hardest for it, found it so elusive.
