Inserting, Changing, Replacing, and Joining

Goal:
The goal of this exercise is to give you practice with the different ways to insert, change, replace and join text.

Instructions:

Open the insert-practice.txt file

First, start a command line session on your local machine.
Next, use vim to open the "insert-practice.txt" file that came in the course downloads.
To do that, navigate to the location of the file.
Remember this could be different for you depending on where you extracted the contents of the file.
This example assumes the course download was saved into your Downloads folder and extracted from there.

cd Downloads
cd vimclass
vim insert-practice.txt

Using the i command

Remember that the i command places you into insert mode right at your current cursor position.
Use i to insert some text at the very begining of the first line in the file.
For example, you might insert "vim".
After you  have inserted the text, return to normal mode with <Escape>.

Using the I command

Move down to the next line of text by type 2j.
Your cursor will be in the middle of this line:
