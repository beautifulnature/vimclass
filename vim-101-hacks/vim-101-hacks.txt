## Types of Vim Modes

There are several modes in Vim.
For easy understanding let us separate these into 2 categories - basic modes and advanced modes.

### Basic Vim Modes

It is absolutely essential to understand these 3 basic modes to use the Vim editor effectively.

|==|==|
|Mode|Description|
|Normal|The Vim editor starts in this mode, where you can execute all editor commands.|
|Insert|This mode is for inserting text.|
|Command Line|This mode is for execting ex commands at the bottom of the editor. For example, :wq|

Let's assume you want to create a helloworld.txt with the text "Hello World!".
The following steps explain how you do this with the help of these 3 modes.

Step 1: Normal mode. Open the new file in Normal mode.

$ vim helloworld.txt

Step 2: Insert Mode. Go to Insert mode, and type Hello World!

i

Step 3: Command Line mode. Go to command line mode and type :wq to save the file and exit the editor.

<ESC> :wq

### Advanced Modes

While these are not essential for a typical usage, it is good to understand all available Vim modes.

|==|==|
|Mode|Description|
|Visual|You can select text (Using v, V or Ctrl-V) in visual mode and execute Vim commands|
|Select|From :help vim-modes-intro
"Typing a printable character deletes the selection and starts Insert mode.|
In this mode, "--SELECT--" is shown at the bottom of the window."|
|Ex|From :help vim-modes-intro
"Like Command-line mode, but after entering a command you remain in Ex mode"|

## Moving around a File
